# Postgres-Postgis-GeoSpatialDB
Plotted convex-hull, and found out the three nearest neighbors of a point using Google Earth, .kml files and Postgres+Postgis

Another thing done was to plot a spirograph with Seeley G. Mudd, LA at the centre.

Screenshots of the results can be found under the screeshot folder.
