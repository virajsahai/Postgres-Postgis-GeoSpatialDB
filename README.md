# Postgres-Postgis-GeoSpatialDB
Plotted convex-hull, and found out the three nearest neighbors of a point using Google Earth, .kml files and Postgres+Postgis

Another thing done was to plot a spirograph with Seeley G. Mudd, LA at the centre.

Screenshots of the results are also present ending in .jpg.

point_gen.cpp generates points for the spirograph which are then copy-pasted to spiro.kml to plot it.
